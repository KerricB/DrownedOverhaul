## üìñ Overview
**DrownedOverhaul** transforms Minecraft‚Äôs oceans into a place of genuine peril.  
This plugin reimagines the behavior of Drowned mobs, letting them grab players underwater and drag them toward the depths.

Features include:
- **Drowned Grab Mechanic**: Drowned mobs can now latch onto players underwater.
- **Multi-Grab Support**: Up to **4** drowned can pull a single player, increasing drag force.
- **Configurable Settings**: Server owners can tweak grab range, pull strength, and more.
- **Failsafe Handling**: Prevents infinite grab loops or buggy escape behavior.
- **Lightweight & Server-Friendly**: Designed for **PaperMC** (works on Spigot/Purpur too).
